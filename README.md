# Effective Entailment Checking for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions: Supplementary Material

## Proofs and Extended Experimental Evaluation

All proofs and an extended experimental evaluation can be found in a separate [appendix](https://github.com/katelaan/entailment/blob/master/appendix.pdf) avaliable [here](https://github.com/katelaan/entailment/blob/master/appendix.pdf).

## Benchmarks

The complete set of [benchmarks](https://github.com/katelaan/entailment/blob/master/benchmarks.tar.gz) used to evaluate Harrsh are available [here](https://github.com/katelaan/entailment/blob/master/benchmarks.tar.gz).
The linked archive contains all benchmarks used in the experimental evaluation of the paper and the appendix in Harrsh, Songbird and Slide input formats. Note that the results of our evaluation are in the [appendix](https://github.com/katelaan/entailment/blob/master/appendix.pdf).
